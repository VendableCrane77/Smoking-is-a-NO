<strong>Why do we purposely breathe in what we try to avoid from a different source?</strong>

When you smoke, you breathe in <strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong>,<br/>
which is the same <strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong> everyone tries to avoid in exhaust and campfires.<br/>
So why does every smoker think it is alright with the same gas from something even more toxic?

The answer lies in <strong>Nicotine</strong>, a substance found in <strong>Tobacco</strong> that can cause <strong>addiction</strong>.<br/>
However, it is not a <strong>mental addiction</strong>, but a <strong>chemical addiction</strong>.<br/>
Though, <strong>Nicotine</strong> is not the only chemical that can cause problems.

For example, since <strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong> can <strong>bond as easily as Oxygen with Hemoglobin</strong>,<br/>
a protein that helps carry the oxygen to all parts of the body,<br/>
<strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong> can <strong>take the place of Oxygen</strong>,<br/>
needing the heart to <strong>pump oxygenated blood</strong> to the rest of the body <strong>faster</strong>, so the body will not deprive of <strong>Oxygen</strong>.<br/>
This can cause <strong>Tachycardia</strong> and others, which can lead to <strong>death</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Due to its cause for so many problems, <strong>many governments around the globe<br/>
</strong> have decided to <strong>ban the use of cigarettes and vapes</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The particles released in the smoke are <strong>pm2.5</strong>, <strong>30% of the size of a red blood cell</strong>,<br/>
can cause a variation of lung disease like <strong>COPD</strong> and <strong>lung cancer</strong>.<br/>
Therfore, since <strong>1970</strong> and <strong>2018</strong> respectively, Singapore has<br/>
<strong>banned the use of cigarettes and vapes</strong>.
</p>

<p>
However, Singaporean designers have created a designated space for smoking.

<div class="info pad">
<p>
If you are caught <strong>smoking at undesaignated areas</strong>, you can be sentenced to a <strong>fine of up to SGD$1000</strong>.<br/>
If caught <strong>vaping</strong>, you can be sentenced to a <strong>fine of up to SGD$10 000 or jail of up to 6 months or both</strong>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="infoii pad">
<p>
The most important information you should know before smoking is that<br/>
<strong>Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year</strong>,<br/>
which is about <strong>50% of ita users</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, before you light a cigarette bud or vape up,<br/>
remember how many people were killed because of the same action you are about to start.
</p>

<div class="info pad">
<p>
When people smoke, it can be <strong>like starting an engine that cannot stop</strong>,<br/>
or like <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/blog/spotlight-pamela-worth?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=61F6FB491A1F4D828E546160380B2CA2"><strong><mark>Pamela Worth</mark></strong></a> who managed to quit smoking.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if you want to keep fit, remember the words of Maxi Lim,<br/>
starring as Aloysius Jin in the Ah Boys to Men Movies:"<strong>My secret is no cigarette.</strong>"
